#Sound Gradient Generator

Sound gradient generator is a piece of software that allows the user to import an audio file and generate a black-to-white gradient based on audio signal's amplitude values. For example, a normalised amplitude value of 0 would be neutral grey, value of -1 would be black, and value of 1 would be white. The aim of the software is to provide a way of generating visual displacement maps based on sound waves for use in graphics software such as After Effects and Photoshop.
